<summary><b>1. Teach statistics and data science as iterative processes of gleaning insights from data to inform evidence-based decisions.</b></summary>

-   <details>

    <summary><b>We use data to understand the world better.</b></summary>

    In trying to understand the world around us, we have questions. An introductory statistics course should help students

    -   connect data collection and gathering evidence;
    -   derive quantities from data, i.e., statistics, that relate to the questions;
    -   learn about the questions using visualizations, numerical summaries, and inferential procedures involving these statistics or the original data.

    Here, "inferential procedures" refers to statistical methods that convey the *strength* of evidence that bears on scientific questions of interest.

    </details>

    <summary><b>Statistics and the scientific method.</b></summary>

    In one sense, statistics is an implementation of the scientific method, a multi-step process involving forming a question, developing a hypothesis, gathering data, testing the hypothesis, drawing conclusions, and communicating results. These steps all have clear analogues in statistics, and it should be the aim of any introductory statistics course to help students understand both the process and the analogy. Furthermore, science is often an iterative process, where the results lead to more questions and refined hypotheses. Again, the analogy to statistics is straightforward and this iterative process should be exhibited for students via examples in an introductory statistics course.

    Introductory statistics should convey the seamless integration of statistical methods and the scientific method, how visualizations inform inferential statistical methods, and how inferential statistical methods can lead to new related questions. Liberal use of examples drawn from real datasets is essential; see Recommendation 4.

<summary><b>2. Emphasize effective written and oral communication of results from data, with attention to the scope and limitations of conclusions</b></summary>

Producing results is only one step in learning from data; it is crucial for students to be able to effectively communicate their findings. This includes both written and oral communication, ensuring that results are presented clearly and accurately.

Effective communication of the results of data analysis starts with understanding and communicating the provenance and lineage of the data---the source of the data and how it might have changed since---with clear emphasis on how this knowledge affects the conclusions that can be drawn from the data. In addition, effective communication includes an understanding that conclusions drawn from inference or data visualization/analysis represent evidence but not proof. Conclusions drawn from data can help lead us to a clearer understanding and iterations of the process can continue to improve our understanding. Effective communication acknowledges limitations and provides context around the results.

Written communication might take the form of requiring complete sentences in stating conclusions from data or more formal written projects or requiring significant and articulate documentation or comments in data science projects. Oral communication might mean effective communication with users or with peers or it might mean more formal presentations.

-   <details>

    <summary><b>Other examples of written or oral communication:</b></summary>

    -   Writing assignments that include sections on methodology, results, and discussion of the limitations and scope of their findings.
    -   Class presentations focusing on clearly explaining methods, results, and the limitations of their conclusions.
    -   Peer review sessions where students critique each other’s reports or presentations, particularly focusing on how well the scope and limitations of the conclusions are communicated.
    -   Online or in-class discussion forums where students respond to hypothetical scenarios, identifying the scope and limitations of potential conclusions based on provided data and/or case study.
    -   Requiring students to engage in multiple forms of both written and oral communication is particularly valuable.

<summary><b>3. Focus on conceptual understanding rather than algebraic manipulation and formulas.</b></summary>

Given limited time we are able to devote to instruction, it is important to prioritize the ideas that we choose to ask our students to engage with. Technology tools are becoming ubiquitous, students will essentially *always* have internet access, and professional statisticians rely heavily on computing. Thus, there is no statistical reason for students to practice manual calculations of complex statistical formulas. Consequently, manual formulas and algebraic manipulations are not a priority for an introductory statistics course and should be deemphasized or removed completely.

If formulas are used in an introductory statistics context, it should be for the purpose of illustrating concepts rather than obtaining a numerical result. [ I think this should all be deleted.  Sounds like someone is making an argument FOR including formulas!  For example, the formula for sample variance reveals that this measure of spread is roughly the mean squared deviation from the sample mean, which is helpful in understanding why standard deviation is roughly, but not exactly, the mean absolute deviation. In a more advanced course, the divisor of (n--1) in the sample variance formula might inform a conceptual discussion about unbiased estimators. The formula for sample correlation can be expressed as the mean product of two variables after they are both standardized, a fact through which multiple concepts may be better understood.] We see little pedagogical value, from a statistical perspecitve, in numerically calculating a variance, standard deviation, or correlation. On the other hand, demonstrating the computing tools that implement these formulas can have value and may be considered a special case of Recommendation 6.

-   <details>

    <summary><b>Simulation based inference (SBI):</b></summary>

    SBI has been developed to the point where it can form the basis of an entire introductory statistics course. SBI emphasizes concepts of inferential statistics, leveraging computing power rather than relying on large-sample approximations to common families of distributions. Choosing to base an introductory course on SBI has advantages and disadvantages relative to a more traditional approach: While concepts are the focus of SBI and the methods used for SBI are much more flexible than standard inferential methods such as t-, z-, F-, or chi-square-based inference, these standard approaches are still widely used so students may benefit from learning them. These guidelines do not make a recommendation for or against SBI; either approach, or indeed a combined approach, can be effective.

<summary><b>4. Integrate real data with a context and purpose throughout the course. Select data that are meaningful and engaging to the students.</b></summary>

Using real data in context is crucial in teaching and learning statistics, both to give students experience with analyzing genuine data and to illustrate the usefulness and fascination of our discipline. Statistics can be thought of as the science of learning from data, so the context of the data becomes an integral part of the problem-solving experience. The introduction of a dataset should include a context that explains how and why the data were produced or collected. Students should practice formulating good questions and answering them appropriately based on how the data were produced and analyzed.

Using real datasets of interest to students is a good way to engage students in thinking about the data and relevant statistical concepts. Neumann, Hood and Neumann (2013) explored reflections of students who used real data in a statistics course and found the use of real data was associated with students’ appreciating the relevance of the course material to everyday life. Further, students indicated that they felt the use of real data made the course more interesting.

-   <details>

    <summary><b>Suggestions for teachers:</b></summary>

    -   Use real data from studies to enliven your class, motivate students, and increase the relevance of the course to the real world.\
    -   Use data with a variety of contexts as the catalyst for exploration, generating the questions, and informing interpretations to conclusions.\
    -   Consider using class-generated data. Maintain student privacy.
    -   Consider using the same dataset for multiple purposes throughout the course. Encourage students to explore how multiple variables in the datasets relate to one another.
    -   Minimize the use of hypothetical datasets to illustrate a particular point or to assess a specific concept.\
    -   Search web data repositories, textbooks, journal articles, software packages, and websites with surveys/polls for good raw data or summarized data to use in class activities. Expect new sources of data to become available each year.
    -   Expose students to data that they interact with on a regular basis, such as data generated by online social networks or data tracked regularly on mobile smart devices (Gould 2010).
    -   Be alert to the messiness of much real data before using it in a course; better still, expose students to typical issues such as missing observations, inconsistent identifiers, and the challenges of merging data from multiple sources (Carver and Stephens, 2014).
    -   Introduce students to interactive data visualization websites (Ridgway, 2023), such as the Gapminder software (<http://www.gapminder.org>).\
    -   Consider opportunities to align the data sources you select to institutional objectives at your school. You may want to seek out datasets related to expanding students’ global awareness, focusing on social justice concerns, or exploring issues of local importance.
    -   Seek out real data directly from a practicing research scientist or a source at one’s home institution.

<summary><b>5. Encourage multivariable thinking.</b></summary>

Multivariable thinking is critical for students to be able to navigate our complex, data-driven world. It is no longer a luxury---it is a necessity. Instructors are encouraged to help students understand that the world is not univariate or bivariate. Phenomena in areas such as economics, medicine, social sciences, and natural sciences are influenced by a multitude of factors, and there are many sources of data readily available that have lots of cases and many variables. We encourage instructors to include some of these datasets in classes and projects or homework, even when students might only be looking at one or two of the variables at a time. Help students get comfortable working with larger datasets.

Discuss or create data visualizations that have more than two variables. When studying datasets, small or large, discuss other variables that might be relevant and that might have been included. Using datasets with multiple variables, challenge students working in small groups to create a visual story that explains a real-world scenario using the data. Spend time discussing confounding variables and interactions such as Simpson’s paradox.

While multiple regression is one way to encourage multivariable thinking, it is not the only way nor is it the exact target of this recommendation. There are many other ways to encourage students to consider multiple variables in their thinking.

While using simple regression as a teaching tool, help students understand that multiple regression is often more practical. Using an example like a website estimating home prices, ask students whether the home price can be accurately estimated from a single variable. Discuss with students the shortcomings of only considering square footage, or any other single variable. Ask them which other variables might be needed to calculate an accurate estimate of home price. Emphasize that because the world is complex, phenomena typically cannot be understood using a single variable.

<summary><b>6. Incorporate software/apps to explore concepts and work with data.</b></summary>

Given the ubiquity of data in the modern environment, students may be working with complex real-world datasets, even in the introductory course. Therefore, it is important that students become proficient in the tools that will equip them to work with such data. Incorporating statistical software and/or apps in your course provides students an opportunity to be more creative and expansive in their analysis approach than they might have the ability to be with more limited technology, such as a graphing calculator. Teaching students how to use statistical software and/or apps also prepares them to do statistical analysis beyond the course and potentially prepare them for data analysis in future research, internships, and careers. Additionally, these tools can help students more effectively learn statistical concepts, not just apply them.

The goal of this document is not to prescribe a specific technology. In fact, most software tools are similar, so students can transfer knowledge about one tool as they start to work with others.

-   <details>

    <summary>Here are a few points to consider as you select technology for your course:</summary>

    -   What is the assumed computing background of your student population? This will help determine a tool that is the appropriate level for the course.
    -   What is the primary student audience? Is this a course for statistics majors or a general education course? This will help determine what technology skills may be most helpful for your students’ future careers.
    -   What resources are available to students in and outside of the classroom? Consider a web browser based platform, rather than installed software, that students can access from a variety of devices.
    -   How is the course designed to support student learning of new technology? For example, students will require more in-class time to support learning a code-based platform rather than an app or point-and-click based platform.
    -   Additional information to about each of these considerations is available in the section below on teaching coding.

<summary><b>7. Emphasize responsible and ethical conduct in the collection and use of data and in their analysis.</b></summary>

As articulated in the [Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice](https://zenodo.org/records/7092386) as published by the American Statistical Association (2022), "Good statistical practice is fundamentally based on transparent assumptions, reproducible results, and valid interpretations." Such guidelines have existed for decades (Hurwitz and Gardenier, 2012), other professional statistical organizations have published similar documents (e.g., International Statistical Institute, 2018), and, more recently, guidelines for ethical data science have been developed (e.g., Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and Royal Statistical Society, 2019). Such practice should extend to the statistics classroom as well.

Many of the time-tested professional ethical guidelines in the publications above have direct relevance in the statistics classroom. In addition, the field of statistics is changing, and with these changes come new ethical imperatives in statistics education. As Rameela Raman, Jessica Utts, Andrew Cohen, and Mathew Hayat write in a 2023 article in *The American Statistician*, "with technological advancement and the increase in availability of real-world datasets, it is necessary that instruction also integrate the ethical aspects around data sources, such as privacy, how the data were obtained and whether participants consent to the use of their data."

Ideally, Recommendation 7 should not stand on its own but rather influence each of the other recommendations. This is precisely the philosophy of Raman et al. (2023), the full text of which is available at <https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2022.2156612>.

<summary><b>8. Employ evidence-based pedagogies that actively engage students in the learning process.</b></summary>

Active learning has been described as a set of approaches that involve students in doing things and thinking about the things they are doing (Bonwell and Eison 1991). Using active learning methods in class allows students to discover, construct, and understand important statistical ideas as well as to engage in statistical thinking. Other benefits include the practice students get communicating in statistical language and learning to work in teams to solve problems. Activities provide teachers with a method of assessing student learning and provide feedback to the instructor on how well students are learning. A recent meta-analysis (Freeman et al. 2014) concludes that there are distinct advantages in terms of course outcomes when active learning is employed in STEM courses.

Instructors should not underestimate the learning gains that can be achieved with activities or overestimate the value of lectures to convey information. Embedding even brief activities within lectures can break the natural occasional dips in attention associated with passive or minimally engaged listeners.

Whereas some rich activities can take an entire class session, many valuable activities need not take much time. A think-pair-share discussion or prediction exercise may take only 2-3 minutes, which might otherwise be spent in redundant lecturing due to audience inattention. Collecting on-the-spot data may take more time but reaps benefits beyond the single activity that prompted the collection (see Recommendation 4).

What do we want besides active learning? Consider high-impact practices from AAC&U: <https://www.aacu.org/trending-topics/high-impact>.

-   <details>

    <summary><b>Suggestions for teachers:</b></summary>

    -   Ground activities in the context of real data with a motivating question.
    -   Consider the student's need for physical explorations (e.g., die rolling, card drawing) prior to the use of computer simulations to illustrate or practice concepts.
    -   Encourage predictions from students about the results of a study that provides the data for an activity before analyzing the data. This motivates the need for statistical methods. (If all results were predictable, we would not need either data or statistics.)
    -   Avoid activities that lead students step-by-step through a list of procedures. Instead, allow students to discuss and think about the data and the problem.
    -   When planning activities, be sure there is enough time to explain the problem, let the students work through the problem, and wrap-up the activity during the same class period.
    -   Consider low-/no-stakes peer assessment (where students comment on or rate a classmate’s work) within class to provide quick feedback and to improve the quality of final assessments. Ideas: Active learning, gamification, transparency
    -   Use apps, projects, in-class activities, work with your neighbor, explain to your neighbor, clicker quizzes, have students teach a topic or a principle to the class, group work, ...

<summary><b>9. Use a variety of formative and summative assessments to improve teaching and learning.</b></summary>

There are a wide variety of assessments for statistics courses, and each have the opportunity to provide valuable feedback for students and instructors when used effectively in a course. There are two basic types of assessments: formative and summative. *Formative assessments* help instructors monitor student learning by providing ongoing, and typically immediate, feedback. *Summative assessments* are used to evaluate student learning at the end of a unit in the course (Eberly Center, 2024).

Formative assessments are low-stakes assessments that provide students and instructors immediate feedback about students' learning and understanding of the course content. They are typically counted for little to no points in a students' grade, as their purpose is to provide feedback throughout the learning process. For example, using clicker-type quizzes during class encourages students to reflect on and apply the content they've just learned. Clicker-type quizzes also give instructors immediate time feedback about the class's general understanding, and they can use this information to determine how to proceed next in the class period. [Reference something about just-in-time teaching here?]

Summative assessments, such as exams and final projects, provide students an opportunity to demonstrate their learning of the content and understanding of application. These are often done at major milestone points in the course, such as in the midterm and end of the semester. Instructors have the opportunity to make these assessments meaningful to assess students' ability to apply the course content in a context most similar to how they may engage with it outside of the course. Summative assessments that occur during the term can provide students and instructors opportunities to reflect on current learning and make adjustments accordingly the remainder of the term.

Instructors may also utilize tools such as mid-semester surveys and classroom observations to assess and improve their teaching. These mechanisms give instructors another view into the student experience, such as the classroom environment and considerations around accessibility and inclusion, that are not easily evaluated through student performance.

<summary><b>10. Implement a course design that uses inclusive strategies to foster a sense of belonging.</b></summary>

Inclusive course design encourages us to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to teaching and instead consider how diverse learning styles, experiences, and backgrounds can contribute to a more dynamic and engaging learning environment.This requires mutual respect between the instructor and the students. It includes building a classroom culture of mutual respect between students and their peers. It might start with creating a syllabus that is more welcoming than punitive. It might mean re-branding office hours as “student hours” and holding them in a non-threatening location. It might mean including group work in the course design, and overtly discussing how to work effectively and respectfully with all group members. It might mean making an effort, where possible, to get to know all students individually. Students who feel like they don’t belong or who fear being judged are less likely to participate in discussions, ask questions, or seek help when they need it.

In all cases, it means treating students with respect and dignity. It encourages instructors to know their audience, and to avoid using jargon, sayings, and cliches that may not be understood by students from different cultures. Incorporating case studies or examples that are relevant to students from different cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds can make the material more relatable and engaging. Students who feel respected in their academic environment are more likely to persist.
